Coming from a background in competitive swimming, I learned quite early on to work hard on my goals without much of a reward, which is also why I thought that science might be a good career. Well, what I actually learned is that certain goals won't make a good incentive as a reward, as you never really know whether things will work out. 
Instead I feel that what really works for me is not to try reaching something in the future, but right now. It is about the believe that whatever I am doing at the moment is a good thing.  

Although having mostly studied Psychology and Neurosciences, I'm doing a PhD somewhere in between ecology, genetics, seals, programming and statistics. I am especially passionate about making a little difference as a young scientist for the science system. I feel that caring about statistical analyses as well as sharing data and code can cause a real change in the future. Apart from publishing my  <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/36/E5005?tab=ds" target="blank">data and sharing documented code</a> with <a href="https://mastoffel.github.io/mastoffel.github.io/coding/2016/10/25/reproducibility.html" target="blank">RMarkdown</a>, I enjoy writing R-packages to make the code I am developing available for a wide range of researchers. For details about my work and publications please visit my my <a href="https://thehoffmanlab.com/group/martin-stoffel/" target="blank">lab's</a> website. I am always open for collaborations!
