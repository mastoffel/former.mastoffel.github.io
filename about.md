*â€œTwo things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."* -Kant

This is one of the quotes which I discussed a lot with a good friend of mine during my studies. I feel it now has become a little piece of wisdom which I consider to be a key part of my life as a young scientist. For me, the quote is about accepting and respecting that there are things you cannot grasp and about keeping a truly open and interested mindset. Even more important, it emphasized the need to constantly reflect upon our own moral. 

Although coming from a background in Psychology and Neurosciences, I'm doing a PhD somewhere in between ecology, genetics, programming and statistics. For details about my work and publications please visit my my <a href="https://thehoffmanlab.com/group/martin-stoffel/" target="blank">lab's</a> website. Feel free to contact my per mail (see little symbols at the bottom) if you have any questions or ideas for collaborations in science, adventures, R programming and data analysis, photography or whatever comes to your mind!
