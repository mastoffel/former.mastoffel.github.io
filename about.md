How a good friend of mine always told me: It's not important where you come from, but where you go to. This is why I use this blog as a reflection of my current ideas, opinions and life. Whoever is interested in the science IÂ´m doing can visit my <a href="https://thehoffmanlab.com/group/martin-stoffel/" target="blank">lab's</a> website. If you want to have a look at the coding part of my projects, just visit my GitHub profile by clicking on the little cat at the bottom. I'm happy get contacted for new science collaborations, nature expeditions, data analysis or visualization projects or whatever else comes to someones mind when reading my blog (click on the letter on the bottom to write me a mail).
