The Northern Elephant Seal has been hunted by humans to near extinction during the 19th century. Although some seals survived and the population recovered to way over 100000 individuals nowadays, the loss of genetic diversity might have severe consequences in a changing world.

 This picture is from an epic hike down the bright angel trail and up the south kaibab trail on the Grand Canyon south rim. The hike was extremely exhausting, and the lack of water sources on the way up did not make it easier. However, the diversity of the landscapes and wildlife and the stunning views made it one of the most memorably hikes I ever did.

Monarch butterflies from the west of the Rocky Mountain Range overwinter in California along the coast. The coastal forests provide a similar microhabitat to the mountains of Mexico, where other monarchs overwinter. It's rather cold, which is why fewest show their beautiful oranged colored wings and most of them rather resemble leaves.
