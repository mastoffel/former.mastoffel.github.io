After being on a Russian Icebreaker as part of the [ACE Expedition](http://spi-ace-expedition.ch/) for a month, we really enjoyed the beauty of South Africa.

The Great White Shark is marked as "vulnerable" by the [IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3855/0). Indeed, people working with Great Whites in South Africa told us, that the population estimate around the South African coast is as low as 500 individuals.

The African or Jackass Penguin is the only Penguin species endemic to South Africa. It is classified as endangered by the [IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22697810/0). The population has declined from around 4 million individuals at the beginning of the 19th century to just around 50000 individuals nowadays. If this decline keeps going, the Penguin will be extinct in 15 years time. The main reason is not necessary habitat loss due to humans, but commercial fisheries and a general change in the coastal ecosystems of South Africa due to human impact. Boulder's beach provides a unique opportunity to get in touch with these animals and to raise awareness. However, I felt that the respect towards these animals was often lacking and a certain harmony was established purely by a hard working conservationist on the beach who worked there without any payment and his own material.
