When I look carefully  
I see the *nazuna* blooming  
By the hedge.  

### Basho


In his excellent book "To Have or to Be?", Erich Fromm uses this peom to illustrate a "being" instead of "having" attitude of life. Basho sees the flower and looks at it, without any need to pick it or take it with him.
