title: a tree's dream
---

A single fir-tree, lonely,
on a northern mountain height,
sleeps in a white blanket,
draped in snow and ice.

His dreams are of a palm-tree,
who, far in eastern lands,
weeps, all alone and silent,
among the burning sands.

### Heinrich Heine


I think that one of the main reason's for Heinrich Heine's popularity is that his peom's hit timeless and deeply human feelings, wishes and believes. The fir-tree in the peom is unhappy with his life in the cold northern mountains and all he longs for is to be one these lucky palm trees in the south. However, looking closely, the palm tree itself isn't happy with all the heat and loneliness. The message? Being content with what you have!
