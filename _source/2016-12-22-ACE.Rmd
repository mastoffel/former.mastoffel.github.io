### The Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition
<br>
Roughly one year ago, Frederic Paulsen, a philantropist and businessman came up with the idea to initiate the first scientific circumnavigation of Antarctica including stops at all the subantarctic islands. The incredible journey following this initial idea within just 12 months is barely believable. In Switzerland, the Polar Institute has been founded and the Akademik Tryoshnikov, a Russian icebreaker, has been hired including a 60 man and women-strong crew. International science teams from a variety of disciplines applied for projects, of which the best 22 have been selected. The overarching goal of the expedition is to advance our understanding of the ecosystems of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, which are believed to play a fundamental role in global climate change.
You can follow the expedition on the official [blog](http://spi-ace-expedition.ch/).

### Crossing the Atlantic with the ACE Maritime University
<br>
For the first part of the expedition or leg 0, the Akademik Tryoshnikov sailed from Bremerhaven in Germany to Cape Town in South Africa. Inspired by a program on the german Polarstern, the ACE team decided to organise a Maritime University and bring together 49 postgraduate students from over 10 different countries and numerous scientific backgrounds. For me, the true value of the ACE Maritime University went far beyond broadening my knowledge about the oceans and gaining experience at sea. It was about the inspiration I gained from the students and scientists on board, about the perspectives on the problems our earth faces, and the awareness of my role as a scientist in our society. The cruise connected us not just as scientist, but as friends, and this us worth a lot and in a world that seems to drift apart.

Crossing borders - the idea behind the expedition. All research teams are international collaborations and the cruise combines many scientific disciplines, from oceanography to biology.

A CTD for measuring salinity, temperature and flourescence in up to 1000 meters depth and to take watersamples for different projects.

One of the two helicopters on board. These are the helicopter used for the [South Georgia rat eradication program](http://www.sght.org/sght-habitat-restoration-project/), a large scale project to preserve endangered wildlife on South Georgia.

Whenever we had some time, we watched out for wildlife, and occasionally we were lucky. Pilot whales, several species of dolphin and flying fish crossed out way, amongst others.

The calm water of the tropics provided an excellent opportunity to capture the flying fish.

Arguably one of the most important projects on the expedition investigates the influence of plastics floating in the ocean on the food web.

The rare free time on board was spent well..
