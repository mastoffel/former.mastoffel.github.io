### P'u or the Uncarved Block
An essence of Taoism is simplicity, naturality, honesty. Changing the original simplicity of a thing will spoil it's beauty and power. This principle is called P'u or the Uncarved Block. So what does it all mean? Well, when you discard arrogance and complexity and some other things, you will discover the secrets of the Uncarved Block: Life flows, is fun. However, understanding the Uncarved Block should't be an intellectual exercise. Just read 'A House at Pooh Corner' and the 'Tao of Pooh' for good illustrations.

### Science and the Uncarved Block  
Trying to be simple about complicated things is not easy, but it should be one of the main aims of a scientist. It is not just about reaching the people with the research you did or the paper you wrote. It is also about simplicity of the own mind. I think that being able to zoom out and capture the essence and the meaning of a problem makes a good scientist.
